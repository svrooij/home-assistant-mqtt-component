# Sonos2mqtt companion

The default [MQTT](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/) integration for Home Assistant does not have support for **Media Players**.
To get the speakers from sonos2mqtt into homeassistant you have to use this component (and enable discovery for sonos2mqtt)

## Installation

1. Install [HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/prerequisites)
2. Add a [custom repository](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories)
3. Look for the mqtt integration and click install

## Works with

This integration and [Sonos2mqtt](#sonos2mqtt) are both build by [me](https://svrooij.io/) and work perfectly toghether. If you build a media player that also emits mqtt messages, you should be able to get it to work for your own media player with minor changes. Just send a [PR][link_integration-pr]

### Sonos2mqtt

[![Sonos2mqtt][badge_sonos-mqtt]][link_sonos-mqtt] [![docker pulls][badge_sonos-mqtt-docker]][link_sonos-mqtt-docker] [![sonos2mqtt issues][badge_sonos-mqtt-issues]][link_sonos-mqtt-issues]

The latest beta version of Sonos2mqtt ([3.2.0-beta.7](https://github.com/svrooij/sonos2mqtt/releases/tag/v3.2.0-beta.7)) has support for sending the correct mqtt discovery messages. And works perfectly in combination with this home assistant integration.

Thousands of users are already using this application, according to the amount of Dockerhub pulls.

The most noteworthy feature is support for [notifications](https://svrooij.io/sonos2mqtt/control/notifications.html), which actually restore playback after playing.

## Other media players

By utializing mqtt, and sending the correct messages from the media player you can easily accomplish media player support with local push without the need to touch home assistant. It's just a matter of sending the correct messages.

### Existing Sonos integration

The current [Sonos integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/sonos/) does not really support **Play this sound and revert back to original**. It only works 25% of the time, messing up the current playlist the rest of the time.

This does not replace the sonos integration (but is can...), you can run both at the same time.
